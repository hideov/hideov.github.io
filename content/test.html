 <!-- <p><span class="title">Uchronia: Practice-led research project at the intersection of design, chronobiology and chronosociology</span><span class="main">Within the last 200 years, the Western world has gone through a process of transformation from an agricultural to an urbanised 24/7 society. The shift in dominance from natural time to the mechanical clock has significantly influenced biological and social rhythms. Modern technology has led to an increasing temporal fragmentation, heralding an era of flexible time with ever more complex processes of synchronisation. The prevailing clock-based time persisted with greater precision (atomic clock), but societal synchronisation dynamics have changed over time due to digital technologies. For instance, punctuality gave way to flexibility, which is now the decisive factor in the pace of postmodern or ‘hypermodern’ life. Our society is described as an ‘instant network society’ or ‘digital society’, suffering from increasing time pressure and the acceleration of time. The natural rhythmicity of the human biological clock, however, conflicts with such contemporary algorithmic structures and inhumane rhythms.
</span></p><p><span class="main">My practice-based research investigates an alternative time system based on the human circadian rhythm. It explores the possibility to think outside the boundaries of clocks, and calendars. In an interdisciplinary approach, the research combines two theoretical strands. The first, chronobiology, deals with the temporality of the human body, and the second, chronosociology, investigates the principles and structures of temporal systems in societies. The practice element conceives an alternative temporal system developed and realised in the form of a biotemporal and sociotemporal architectural space. It is an original artistic visualisation and exploration of how scientific research can be translated into a lived, aesthetic experience. In distinct experiments, participants live in a homeorhythmic space, pursuing their own independent rhythm, irrespective of today’s temporal organisation. By developing a temporal utopia, termed uchronia, the project challenges thought patterns regarding the temporal structure of contemporary, technology driven life.
